# Sudoku Solver
**Overview**<br/>
The Sudoku Solver is an interactive graphical application developed using Pygame, designed to solve and manage Sudoku puzzles. The application allows users to visually input and solve puzzles, providing a user-friendly interface for both beginners and enthusiasts.<br/><br/>


**Features**
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Developed an interactive Sudoku solver using Pygame, enabling users to input and solve puzzles visually.<br/>
- **User Input Handling:** Implemented keyboard and mouse interactions for selecting cells, inputting numbers, and solving the puzzle.<br/>
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Applied the backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles, ensuring that even sparse but invalid boards are solved efficiently and provide sthe correct olutions.<br/><br/><br/>

**Technical Implementation**
- **Pygame Library:** Utilized Pygame for GUI development, including window creation, event handling, and graphical updates.<br/>
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Managed user inputs through event handling to facilitate interaction with the Sudoku board.<br/>
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Implemented and optimised a backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles, demonstrating problem-solving and algorithm design skills.<br/>
- **Data Structures:** Used appropriate data structures for managing and solving the Sudoku board, showcasing knowledge of optimisation and complexity.<br/><br/><br/>

**Skills Demonstrated**
- Proficiency in using Pygame for GUI development and interactive applications.<br/>
- Strong understanding of backtracking algorithms and their application to problem-solving.<br/>
- Ability to manage user inputs and provide real-time feedback in a graphical environment.<br/><br/><br/>


**Team**
- **Max Busato:** Lead Developer, responsible for core gameplay mechanics and overall project coordination, as well as implementing graphics and user input handling.<br/><br/><br/>


**Installation and Setup**
- **Clone the Repository:**<br/>
  git clone https://github.com/busatmd021/SudokuSolver.git<br/><br/>

- **Navigate to the Project Directory:**<br/>
  cd SudokuSolver<br/><br/>
 
- **Build the Project:**
